# UFOs
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that displays data associated with UFO sightings in 2010. In addition, filters were added to the webpage that allow users to filter by date, city, state, country and UFO shape.  

## Results
Given that there is a significant amount of data included on UFO sightings, filters have been included that allow users to look only at sightings that match specific criteria. For example, below you can see three screenshots. The first shows the data without any filters on it. The second shows a user that is only interested in seeing sightings that took place in the state of California. The third demonstrates how the filtering can be used to narrow results even more by choosing only one city (Fresno) in the state of California. This filtering feature gives users the ability to dramatically decrease the number of data items they are reviewing, making the data easier to read and understand.

## Summary 
One of the drawbacks of the current design is that unless the user is already very familiar with the data it would be hard for them to know all the options they have for filtering. Based on this I would recommend including a drop down feature on the existing filters so users could scroll through all their options. Another feature that would improve the overall page would be to change the date filter to allow for multiple selections or allow for a sliding scale filtering. This would allow users to search over a period of weeks or months instead of just a specific day.
